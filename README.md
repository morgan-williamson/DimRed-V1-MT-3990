# communication-subspace
Code adapted from  "Cortical areas interact through a communication subspace", Semedo et al. (Neuron, 2019)

v0.1

This code pack requires the use of MATLAB version 2012b or newer.

1) Change MATLAB workspace directory to root folder

1.5) if you have the data as pulled from M3, move the SDFs and exclusions files into the relevant folders in /data

2) run preprocess.m to generate preprocessed data, or take it as already generated ({animal code}_{penetration number}_ori_{stimulus orientation number as in SDFs file}_{stimulus type as in SDFs file}_pp.mat)

3) Run RRR_vs_RidgeR.m or example_adapted.m
